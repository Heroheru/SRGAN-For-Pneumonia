# IMPLEMENTATION OF SUPER-RESOLUTION GAN (SRGAN) FOR ENHANCING CHEST X-RAY IMAGE RESOLUTION IN PNEUMONIA  PATIENTS

![SRGAN Banner](assets/comparing.png)

##  Overview

This project was developed to complete my undergraduate final thesis. It applies a **Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN)** to enhance chest X-ray images for pneumonia patients by reconstructing high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs.

The model uses a modified loss function tailored to X-ray characteristics (ChexNet Feature Extractor Layers)  to improve structural clarity and diagnostic quality.

Important Notes
This repository is dedicated to inference and model evaluation only.
The training process was conducted separately as part of the research and is not included in this repository due to scope and reproducibility considerations.

Model Information
model_generator_069.py contains the SRGAN generator architecture with pre-trained weights, developed and trained in the context of this study and prior experimental work by the author.

##  Dataset

* Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-ray Dataset
* https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2
* Total: **4,273 pneumonia chest X-ray images**

---

## Architecture
![SRGAN architecture](assets/architecture.png)
---

## Modification
![SRGAN modif](assets/modification.png)
the X-Ray Pneumonia Classification Pre-Trained Model CheXNEt is used as modified loss method. This project used some feature extractor layers such as dense block 2 and 3 to extact the information between SR images and Ground Truth images.

## Results

| Metric | Value    |
| ------ | -------- |
| SSIM   | 0.8598   |
| PSNR   | 32.77 dB |
| MOS    | 4.0      |

##  Comparison

Compared with:

* SRResNet
* Pre-trained SRGAN (DIV2K)

The proposed model achieves the best performance in both **visual quality and quantitative metrics**.
